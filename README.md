Hello! I'm bbeetlesam, the creator of Numdle.
This is my first game project (and my first experience using GitHub), and I created it using Pygame module in Python language.

If you want to check what's behind the game, you can check them in this repository!
This repository contains assets that used in the game, such as sfx, font, and other things.

You can follow my media profiles if you want to know more about me, or just simply curious about who is me.

This game is an open-source game, which means you can edit, share, or remake the game! (just don't claim that this is 100% your work)
Feel free to contact me through my social media above!
Sincerely, Sam.
