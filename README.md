Hello! I'm bbeetlesam, the creator of Numdle.
This is my first game project (and my first experience using GitHub), and I created it using Pygame module in Python language.

If you want to check what's behind the game, you can check them in this repository!
This repository contains assets that used in the game, such as sfx, font, and other things.

You can follow my media profiles if you want to know more about me, or just simply curious about who is me.

This game is open, which means you can modify any aspect of this game! 
If you have any suggestions on your mind, feel free to tell me through Instagram, or any other social media! 

Sincerely, Sam.
